A NativeScript plugin for making in-app purchases.

## Installation
Run the following command from the root of your project:

`tns plugin add nativescript-purchase`

This command automatically installs the necessary files, as well as stores nativescript-purchase as a dependency in your project's package.json file.

In order to get intellisense and make TypeScript compile without problems, add the following to your `references.d.ts`:
```typescript
/// <reference path="./node_modules/nativescript-purchase/nativescript-purchase.d.ts" />
```

## Configuration
In order your in-app purchases to be recognized by the plugin you must configure those on the Google/iTunes side. You can check the [in-depth tutorials](#in-depth-tutorial) at the bottom of the page to see how to do it step-by-step. 

## API

### Static Properties
* **transactionUpdatedEvent** - *String*  
String value used when hooking to `transactionUpdated` event.

### Static methods
* **init(string[]): Promise<void>**  
Initializes the plugin for work with the specified in-app purchase identifiers. 

* **getProducts(): Promise<Product[]>**  
Returns the product details *(see below)* for the in-app purchase identifiers that were used in init. 

* **canMakePayments(): boolean**  
Checks whether the current user is allowed to make in-app purchases. 

* **buyProduct(Product, string?): void**  
Buys the given product. On Android you can send custom string data that will be present in the `Transaction`.

* **consumePurchase(string): Promise<number>**  
Consumes the purchases represented by the given transaction token. If the promise returns `0` the consume was successful. Note that this is needed only for Android. For iOS each purchase is automatically consumed when it is set up as a consumabel product in iTunes. 

* **restorePurchases(): void**  
Restores previous purchased items for the current user. 

* **getStoreReceipt(): string**  
Gets the application's Base64 encoded store receipt for the currently logged in store user. This is usefull when checking subscription status under iOS. For Android the function always returns `undefined`.

### Events
* **transactionUpdated**  
Triggered a buy/restore transaction changes its state. You receive a `Transaction` object where you can check the status and other properties  *(see below)* of the transaction. 

### `Product` properties
* **nativeValue**  
The native object representing the product. On iOS this will be an instance of `SKProduct` and on Android this will be a `org.json.JSONObject`

* **productIdentifier** - *string*  
The in-app product identifier as setup on iTunes Connect or Google Store.

* **localizedTitle** - *string*  
The title of the product based on the user's phone localization. 

* **localizedDescription** - *string*  
The description of the product based on the user's phone localization. 

* **priceAmount** - *number*  
The numerical value of the price for this in-app product based on the currency user's app store. 

* **priceFormatted** - *string*  
The formatted `priceAmount` with the corresponding currency symbol of the user's app store. 

* **priceCurrencyCode** - *string*  
The [ISO4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) currency code of the price (for example BGN, EUR, USD, etc.)

* **productType** - *"inapp" | "subs"*  
The type of the product - in-app purchase or subscription

* **subscriptionPeriod** - *string*  
The [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) duration of the subscription. For example `P1D` stands for a daily subscription, `P1M` is a monthly subscription, `P3M` is a three month subscription. The property has a value only for products of type `"subs"`

### `Transaction` properties
* **nativeValue**  
The native value representing the transaction. On iOS this will be an instance of `SKPaymentTransactio` and on Android this will be a `org.json.JSONObject`.

* **transactionState** - *string*  
The state of the transaction. Can be one of the following:
    * Purchased
    * Restored
    * Failed
    * Deferred *(iOS only)*
    * Purchasing *(iOS only)*
    * Refunded *(Android only)*

* **productIdentifier** - *string*  
The in-app product identifier that triggerred this transaction. 

* **transactionIdentifier** - *string*  
The unique identifier of the transaction.

* **transactionDate** - *Date*  
The date of the transaction.

* **transactionReceipt** - *string*  
The Base64 encoded transaction receipt. You can use this to do additional verification on your backend. 

* **originalTransaction** - *Transaction*  
This will be present only when restoring purchases and will contain the original transaction that purchased a given product. 

* **developerPayload** - *string*  
Custom data sent with `buyProduct`. 

* **dataSignature** - *string (Android only)*  
The signature for the transaction.

## Usage

First we need to initialize the plugin with a list for product identifier that will be availabel for purchase. This is best to be done before application start.  
Note that it is possible that the initialization of the plugin takes more time than the application to boot. So especially in the cases that you load the products on your landing page, it is best that to save the `Promise` returned by the `init()` method and then check it before trying to get your products. 

```typescript
import *  as purchase from "nativescript-purchase";
(global as any).purchaseInitPromise = purchase.init(["com.sample.purchase.coolproduct1", "com.sample.purchase.coolproduct2"]);
```

To get the actual products with details (like title, price, currency, etc.) you should use:
```typescript
import { Product } from "nativescript-purchase/product";

(global as any).purchaseInitPromise.then(() => {
    purchase.getProducts().then((products: Array<Product>) => {
        products.forEach((product: Product) => {
            console.log(product.productIdentifier);
            console.log(product.localizedTitle);
            console.log(product.priceFormatted);
        });
    });
});
```

Before proceeding with buying items you should hook up to the `transactionUpdated` event first. This way you will receive information about the transaction state while it is executing and take necessary action when the transaction completes:
```typescript
import { Transaction, TransactionState } from "nativescript-purchase/transaction";
import * as applicationSettings from "application-settings";

purchase.on(purchase.transactionUpdatedEvent, (transaction: Transaction) => {
    if (transaction.transactionState === TransactionState.Purchased) {
        alert(`Congratulations you just bought ${transaction.productIdentifier}!`);
        console.log(transaction.transactionDate);
        console.log(transaction.transactionIdentifier);
        applicationSettings.setBoolean(transaction.productIdentifier, true);
    }
    else if (transaction.transactionState === TransactionState.Restored) {
        console.log(`Purchase of ${transaction.originalTransaction.productIdentifier} restored.`);
        console.log(transaction.originalTransaction);
        console.log(transaction.originalTransaction.transactionDate);
        applicationSettings.setBoolean(transaction.originalTransaction.productIdentifier, true);
    }
    else if (transaction.transactionState === TransactionState.Failed) {
        alert(`Purchase of ${transaction.productIdentifier} failed!`);
    }    
});
```

Now lets buy a product!
```typescript
if (purchase.canMakePayments()) {
    // NOTE: 'product' must be the same instance as the one returned from getProducts()
    purchase.buyProduct(product);
}
else {
    alert("Sorry, your account is not eligible to make payments!");
}
```

NOTE: Because of the difference between iOS and Android in terms of consuming purchases - for iOS this is defined
in the product you add in iTunes Connect and it is consumed automatically, where for Android it has to be done manually - 
if you will be supporting Android you will have to manually consume the purchase by calling the `consumePurchase` method. 
The methods takes a single parameter that is the receipt from the transaction:
```typescript
purchase.on(purchase.transactionUpdatedEvent, (transaction: Transaction) => {
    if (transaction.transactionState === TransactionState.Purchased && transaction.productIdentifier.indexOf(".consume") >= 0) {
        purchase.consumePurchase(transaction.transactionReceipt)
            .then((responseCode) => console.log(responseCode)) // If responseCode === 0 the purchase has been successfully consumed
            .catch((e) => console.log(e));
    }    
});
``` 

And to restore previous purchases to the user's device:
```typescript
purchase.restorePurchases();
```

## Demo
This repository includes a plain NativeScript demo. Note that in order to set up and run the demo you need to have the Grunt CLI installed globally. If you don't have it installed, you can do it by running the following in your shell:
```shell
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```
Once you have Grunt CLI set up in order to set it up the demo run the following in your shell:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/peterstaev/nativescript-purchase
$ cd nativescript-purchase
$ npm install
$ grunt compile
$ cd demo
```
You will not be able to directly run the demo, becuase you need to add your purchases to the stores. Also since I already registered the application id you will have to change that in the `package.json` file located in the `demo` folder. So make sure you read and follow the [in-depth tutorials](#in-depth-tutorial) below in order to get started with the demo.
